# Cow_Face_Detection
Cow Face Detection and Alignment - HICML project

I had to push the notebook as a git-lfs blob.
If it does not work on your end, please use our original Colab notebook:

NOTE:
1. Add a shortcut of our "HCML" drive folder[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xQaIdIBU-nvvek-OR9ott00oIUpBVyIw?usp=share_link] to your Google drive to get started.
2. Run the first and second cells on every new session.
3. Run the last cell (# MAin test inference) to evaluate the model against test data.
4. Run the cell (# === Main ===) to test the model against individual images. You can upload links from the internet.
5. Many of the intermediate cells can be run for all kinds of inferences [Alignment, Detection, Full pipeline detection]
   Note: You may have to run the cells (#helper function - 1 to 4) for this.
